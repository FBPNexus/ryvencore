**ryvencore is not 100% ready yet, there's still some work to do during the next weeks.**

Salut! rvencore is a Qt based framework for building flow-based visual scripting editors for Python. It comes from the Ryven project and will be the foundation for future Ryven versions amongst other editors. ryvencore lets you create Ryven-like editors which you then can optimize for specific domains.

### Installation

```
pip install ryvencore
```

### Features

- **load & save**
- **variables system** with registration mechanism to build nodes that automatically adapt to change of data
- **builtin logging**
- **simple nodes system**
- **dynamic nodes registration mechanism** to register and unregister nodes at runtime
- **right click operations system for nodes**
- **you can add any Qt widgets to your nodes**, hence also embed your Python-Qt applications with GUI in nodes
- **convenience GUI classes**
- **many different modifiable themes** to fit into any environment
- **data *and* exec flow support**
- **stylus support for adding handwritten notes**
- **rendering flow images**

I am very excited about this, but there is of course still room for improvement, currently especially regarding convenience GUI classes and touch support. For a more detailed overview visit the [docs page](https://leon-thomm.github.io/ryvencore/).
